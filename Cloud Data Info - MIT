As a second option, and just a thought is to integrate with service such as Slack & CRM, which in turn would bring enormous benefit for the product and en user. Which then will capture multiple data points, that all integrated will help us equip the repair technician with knowledge  prior to even having the EV in the repair shop. With a net result of faster SLA and Repair time and increase customer CSAT(Customer Satisfaction Score)
